The solution employs the strict comparison operator (`===`) to ensure that both the value and type are checked for equality.
```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;
if ($a === $b) {
    echo "Values are strictly equal";
} else {
    echo "Values are not strictly equal";
}
?>
```
Using `===` avoids the implicit type coercion of the loose comparison, leading to a more accurate and predictable result.  This ensures that only values with identical types and values will be considered equal.
