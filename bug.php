This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to how it handles type juggling and the loose comparison operator (`==`).
```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
    echo "Values are equal";
} else {
    echo "Values are not equal";
}
?>
```
In this example, despite `$a` being a string and `$b` an integer, the loose comparison (`==`) considers them equal. This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with database queries or numerical operations where strict type matching is essential.
